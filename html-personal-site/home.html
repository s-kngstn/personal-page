          I'm Sam, a freelance & open source
          <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/s-kngstn">developer</a>
          currently living in London 🇬🇧. I have built
          <a
            class="underline"
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.samkingston.xyz"
            >samkingston.xyz</a
          >
          as a space to document my work. It also
          serves as a portal to a blog of my personal interests, travels,
          thoughts, notes and opinions.

          <p>
            When I'm not building & breaking things on the web, I enjoy
            traveling to new places, reading, PC gaming, cooking and
            learning new things. I have always been fascinated with technology.
            Learning to program came with the benefit of allowing me to be
            creative, while forcing me to build a tolerance and appreciation for
            critical thinking and problem solving skills. I believe being able
            to break down any problem and solve it is one of the most important
            skills we can develop for ourselves. I am currently building a lot
            of small apps, working on learning a front end framework and looking
            at building modular and reusable components that improve the
            efficiency of old and future code bases. My goal is to build
            something that can make a positive impact in others lives.
