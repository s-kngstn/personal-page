      <p>
        I'm a freelance & open source <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/s-kngstn">developer</a> living in London.
        This website documents my journey and growth as a developer. It also serves as a sort of 'life-wiki'
        of my personal interests, travels, thoughts, notes and opinions. <a class="bio-toggler" id="toggle"> Tell me more</a>
      </p>

      <div id="long-bio">
        <br>
        <p>
          When I'm not building & breaking things on the web, I enjoy reading, building 
          PCs, gaming, cooking and learning new things.
          --- Build a short and long version of your about bio, so that a user can click on more if they want to read more.
          --- Have it toggle the short and long versions of this about page.
          I have always been fascinated with technology. I used to play MMORPGs on my first PC all summer long and get lost in an imaginary world, then as I entered my teens I 
          began tinkering with digital audio workstations like Fruity Loops and Ableton. I found it fascinating that there was software available that 
          allowed me to create and distort sounds with sounds. I took a deep dive into making music this way for a few years. If I didnt know how to do create the sound I wanted, I 
          would crawl the web on internet forums soaking up any knowledge I could. I dont really know where I am going with this. But I'll revist it it later.
          I started coding, building and breaking on the web at the end of 2019 after a long trip abroad. I wanted to find something productive and creative to do in my spare time. Something new,
          that was rewarding like making music felt, and also allowed me to solve problems that I have, or others may have. I think being a problem solver is one of the most important skills
          we can develop for ourselves. Development forces that upon me every day. I really enjoy this profession and hope that eventually I can help create something that will improve someones life 
          in some way. This needs a big re-edit and is a first first first draft lol.

          I am an advocate for data privacy and libre software and believe everyone should be to build & create our own digital footprint.
