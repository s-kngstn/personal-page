          as a space to document my work and growth as a web developer. It also
          serves as a portal to a blog of my personal interests, travels,
          thoughts, notes and opinions.

            When I'm not building & breaking things on the web, I enjoy
            traveling to new places, reading, building PCs, gaming, cooking and
            learning new things. I have always been fascinated with technology.
            After a few months of travel in late 2017 I found myself looking for
            a new challenge. I craved work that could fund future travel plans
            and allow me to see more of this world, but also something that
            would continue to keep me curious. At the time my current work in
            the hospitality industry no longer offered many challenges. It was
            during this time I found programming and web developement. Code came
            with the benefit of allowing me to be creative, while forcing me to
            build a tolerance and appreciation for critical thinking and problem
            solving skills. I believe being able to break down any problem and
            solve it is one of the most important skills we can develop for
            ourselves. I am currently building a lot of small apps, working on
            learning a front end framework and looking at building a platform
            that allows us to trade items instead of buying new. No cash
            transactions, just like-item for another. This is in response to the
            amount of waste we are consuming as a species. My goal is to build
            something that can make a positive impact in others lives.
