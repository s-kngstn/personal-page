        <p>
          I'm a freelance & open source
          <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/s-kngstn">developer</a>
          living in London. I started a company called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webdevise.net">Webdevise</a>, a developement agency focused on bulding affordable and professional looking websites for small to medium businesses. This website documents my showcases my work and growth as a
          web developer. It also serves as a portal to a blog of my personal
          interests, travels, thoughts, notes and opinions.

          <p>
            When I'm not building & breaking things on the web, I enjoy traveling 
            to new places, reading,
            building PCs, gaming, cooking and learning new things. I have always been fascinated with
            technology. After a few months of travel in late 2017 I found myself looking for work that could fund my travel plans while not requiring me to stay in one location for long periods of 
            time. During this time I was introduced to coding and web developement.
            Code also came with the added benefit of allowing me to be creative with technology while forcing me to build a tolerance and appreciation for critical thinking and problem solving skills. I think being able to break down any problem
            and solve it is one of the most important skills we can develop for
            ourselves. My future goal is to build something that can make a positive impact in others lives.
